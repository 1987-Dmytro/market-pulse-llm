# Implementation notes — Phase 3b

Working notes for the step specified in `docs/PROMPT-3b.md` rev. 2 (operator, 2026-07-31):
zero-shot LLM baselines via OpenRouter, an XLM-R supervised baseline, and the Claude Haiku
reference row. Decisions with a lifetime beyond this step live in
`knowledge/decisions/3b-infra-and-precision.md`; this file is the build log.

## Assumptions stated before the code was written

1. **One request per frozen row**, not many rows per request. Batching rows into one prompt would
   let one malformed answer poison several rows and make the parse-failure counter meaningless.
   "Batched with bounded concurrency" is read as concurrency, not prompt-packing.
2. **The prompt is the guideline, compressed.** `docs/annotation/comments.md` and
   `docs/annotation/posts.md` are the definition of the labels, so the zero-shot prompt states
   those rules — including the ones a model cannot guess (retailer's own replies are `unclear`,
   dairy as an ingredient is not relevant, `launch` beats `promo` when both apply). Giving a
   zero-shot model *less* than the annotator had would measure prompt starvation, not the model.
3. **`unclear` is not offered to the model.** The frozen test sets contain zero `unclear` rows
   (400/400, 250/250, 108/108 scoreable), so an `unclear` option could only ever cost a model a
   row. Gold `unclear` handling stays where it belongs — inside the scorer.
4. **No `response_format` / structured-outputs parameter.** One fp8 endpoint in the pinned set
   (`chutes/fp8`) does not advertise `response_format`, and sending a parameter to some rows and
   not others would make the four rows non-comparable. Strict JSON is asked for in the prompt and
   enforced by the parser; formatting wrappers (```json fences, prose around the object) are
   unwrapped before validation and are not counted as failures — a code fence is not a different
   answer.
5. **Reasoning is disabled on every request** (`reasoning: {"enabled": false}`), uniformly. Qwen3.5
   and Qwen3.6 are hybrid-reasoning models; left on, they spend the fixed `max_tokens` thinking and
   return empty content, which would read as a 100% parse-failure rate bought with real money.
6. **Temperature 0, `max_tokens` 256, `seed` 42 where the endpoint accepts it.** 256 is far above
   the ~60 tokens the longest legal answer needs, so truncation is a model behaviour, not a budget
   artefact.
7. **XLM-R is `xlm-roberta-base`, one independent fine-tune per head**, mirroring how the
   TF-IDF+logreg baseline fits one classifier per head. A shared-encoder multi-head model would
   score differently and is not what "the XLM-R baseline" in SPEC §7 names.

## Deviations from `docs/PROMPT-3b.md`

Every departure is logged here. Silence is not compliance.

| # | Contract text | What was done | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | "track actual spend during it (X-Generation-Id header -> GET /api/v1/generation?id=)" | Per-row cost is read from `usage.cost` in the response body (`"usage": {"include": true}`), the same number the generation endpoint returns. The generation endpoint is still implemented and exercised — the live probe looks up its rows by `X-Generation-Id` — and the run total is reconciled against `GET /api/v1/credits` before and after. | 758 extra GETs per model on a serial dependency after every row, for a number the response already carries. The credits delta is a stronger check than either: it counts rows whose record was never written. |
| D2 | "report 'base model errs on N of 108' per candidate" | Three numbers are reported per candidate, not one: sentiment errors, sarcasm errors, and their union, each with its own `n`. | Amendment 3.2 says "misclassifies" and the holdout carries two labels. Picking one reading would be the executor deciding a gate definition. Flagged for the operator at the Phase 4 gate; ADR §(e). |
| D3 | Candidate list annotated "`google/gemma-4-31b-it` (~31B dense, **Gemma Terms of Use**)" | Recorded as **Apache-2.0**. | "record the licence you actually find". The HF card says `license: apache-2.0` and Google's own `gemma_4_license` page is titled "Apache License 2.0". The candidate was not substituted; only the licence annotation differs. |
| D4 | — (addition, not a departure) | `gate_anchor_valid: false` is written into any record where unusable rows exceed 2% of an input. | G1d and G1e are defined *relative to this number*, so a run with holes must not become an anchor by default. Pre-registered before the first request; ADR §(e). |
| D5 | "the frontier row is the same script with the Haiku slug plus `--reference-only`" — with the slug given as `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5:batch` | See "Batch variant" below. | Resolved against the live API before spending; whichever way it resolved is recorded there. |

## Batch variant — resolved 2026-07-31

`anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5:batch` exists on OpenRouter at half price ($0.50/$2.50 per Mtok against
$1.00/$5.00). Whether it returns synchronously through `/chat/completions` was decided by a
single live probe row, not by assumption; the outcome is recorded here after the probe ran.
